C-Archive Extension to Support Task Archiving","messageBody":"- Introduced the Archive feature that enables users to archive tasks, allowing them to remove tasks from the active list while maintaining a record.\n- Added functionality to archive tasks into a separate storage file, preserving task data outside the main task list.\n- Updated the Snipe class to initialise ArchiveList and ArchiveStorage during startup, ensuring archived tasks are managed separately from active tasks.\n- Modified the getResponse method to handle archive commands, providing users with options to archive tasks and view archived items.\n- Added the ability to mark tasks as archived and save them to a designated archive file, making it easy for users to declutter their main task list.\n- Updated UI prompts to inform users when tasks are archived, with distinct messages to differentiate archived lists from active lists.\n- Implemented new command handling for archiving operations, allowing users to archive tasks directly through simple commands.\n- Enhanced error handling and user feedback when interacting with archive functionality, ensuring smooth operation and clear communication.\n- Improved documentation to guide users on how to use the archive feature, including instructions on archiving, viewing archived tasks, and starting fresh with a clean task list.\n\n**Why:**\n- The Archive feature provides a powerful way for users to manage their tasks efficiently by archiving old or completed tasks without losing important historical data.\n- It helps users maintain a focused and organised active task list, enhancing overall productivity and user experience.\n- The archiving capability lays the foundation for future task management enhancements, allowing for improved task lifecycle management within the application.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Explore additional archive-related features, such as restoring tasks from the archive and filtering archived items.\n- Continue refining the user
