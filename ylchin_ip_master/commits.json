maintain.

It makes the codebase more readable, maintainable, and\nscalable by logically grouping related functionalities. Future\ndevelopment and troubleshooting will be easier, as classes will be\nclearly categorized and located.\n\nNo functional changes are introduced; this refactor strictly improves\nthe project structure.\n","tags":["A-Packages"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":27,"deletions":1}}},{"hash":"5b58010b8ac3efaee38ba7281f107380db96cb59","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge commit \u002781a9c537afe8492675eb253968939364d65db091\u0027","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"4ed9ecb90add2465779d65f31045ff56d19871ec","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Automate project builds using Gradle","messageBody":"Project builds are currently managed manually without a standardized\nbuild automation tool.\n\nThis manual process is error-prone and inefficient, making it harder\nto manage dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package\ndistributions consistently. It slows down development and increases\nthe likelihood of build-related errors.\n\nAutomate project builds using Gradle:\n- Add a `build.gradle` file to define project dependencies and build\n  configurations.\n- Include Gradle wrapper files to standardize the Gradle version used\n  across different development environments.\n- Configure tasks for compiling code, running tests, and packaging the\n  application into distributable formats.\n\nUsing Gradle provides a standardized build process, improving\nconsistency and reliability. It simplifies dependency management,\nreduces setup time for new developers, and facilitates integration\nwith CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThis change ensures that all developers and CI systems use the same\nbuild process, enhancing collaboration and project stability.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"java":{"insertions":88,"deletions":6}}},{"hash":"8b8c23558a90762c9d388372b80ed822233c3f52","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Revert \"Automate project builds using Gradle\"","messageBody":"This reverts commit 4ed9ecb90add2465779d65f31045ff56d19871ec.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"java":{"insertions":6,"deletions":88}}},{"hash":"55b7f723c5dd4de5427e753d44ac62cc2f471beb","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Update build.gradle file","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"b1d3dc80736616ea84c0f2dc270e0ddc26fe5c83","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Fixed missing import and package statements","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"java":{"insertions":85,"deletions":4}}},{"hash":"1c095827b94d0ab28914d3035ddd6e5718180942","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge commit \u002755b7f723c5dd4de5427e753d44ac62cc2f471beb\u0027","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Gradle"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"ylchin":{"java":612,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":1,"bat":1,"gradle":2,"txt":7}},"authorContributionVariance":{"ylchin":40870.227},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"ylchin":"CS2103T-F13-2 CHIN..LING"}}
