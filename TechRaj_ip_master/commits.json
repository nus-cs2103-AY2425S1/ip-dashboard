The assertions ensure that invalid inputs do not\ncause unexpected behavior during runtime.\n\nKey changes include:\n- TaskList: Added assertions to check for non-null tasks and valid indices\n  in addTask, deleteTask, and get methods.\n- Ui: Added assertions to validate non-null message inputs before displaying\n  messages or errors.\n- Parser: Added assertions to ensure valid command parsing.\n\nThese changes improve the robustness of the system by catching potential\nerrors early in the program execution.\n","tags":["A-Assertions"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":20,"deletions":1}}},{"hash":"aa425bcd5a9f04dc0140645d1834717f822bc62d","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge

across the application","messageBody":"Refactor several classes to improve code readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards:\n\n- Extracted complex logic into smaller methods in the `Storage` class to reduce arrowhead anti-pattern.\n- Introduced method-specific validation checks to ensure better error handling.\n- Improved consistency with naming conventions and encapsulation throughout.\n- Added missing Javadoc comments to ensure comprehensive documentation.\n- Ensured that wildcards in imports are removed and replaced with explicit class imports to improve clarity.\n\nThese changes improve the overall structure and readability of the code, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.\n","tags":["A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":235,"deletions":81}}},{"hash":"514c00e5f899ae11a1c36897a5e1a864187edd3e","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge

Implemented a new `PriorityCommand` that allows users to filter tasks by their priority level (high, medium, or low).\n- Added `parsePriorityCommand` in the `Parser` class to correctly handle the `priority` command input.\n- Enhanced validation in the `parsePriorityCommand` to ensure only valid priority levels (high, medium, or low) are accepted.\n- Updated the `TaskList` to filter tasks based on the specified priority.\n- Integrated priority filtering into the command execution flow and ensured that results are properly displayed via the UI.\n\nThis new feature allows users to easily view tasks based on their urgency or importance, improving task management and organisation within the
