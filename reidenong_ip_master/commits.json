The README provides an overview of Barry\u0027s features and how it helps users manage tasks effectively.\n\nSummary of the README:\n\n- **Introduction**:\n  - Brief description of Barry as a chatbot that helps users manage their tasks efficiently.\n\n- **Features**:\n  - Detailed explanation of Barryâ€™s key features, including adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and finding specific tasks.\n\n- **Task Management**:\n  - Explanation of how Barry categorizes tasks into To-Dos, Deadlines, and Events.\n\n- **User Commands**:\n  - Overview of the user commands for managing tasks, including adding, marking, deleting, and searching tasks.\n\n- **How Barry Helps**:\n  - Summary of Barry\u0027s simplicity and how it helps users stay organized and productive.\n\n---\n\nThis README will help users understand the capabilities of Barry and how to interact with it to manage their daily tasks.\n","tags":["A-FullCommitMessage"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"md":{"insertions":23,"deletions":17}}},{"hash":"43dc77c0047a9b59c1b5283782daabffea68c708","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge pull request #4 from reidenong/branch-A-JavaDoc","messageBody":"Add README for Barry Task Manager","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"30ed13a7519b0f0b1d698a86bf4d83810803186c","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Assertions to Document Important Assumptions in Parser Class","messageBody":"This commit introduces the use of Java\u0027s `assert` feature to document and enforce important assumptions throughout the `Parser` class. Assertions help ensure that the input and arguments passed to various commands meet expected conditions before processing, improving code robustness and preventing potential runtime errors.\n\nKey Changes:\n- Added assertions to ensure the following assumptions hold:\n  - **Non-null and non-empty input**: Added assertions to check that user input is neither null nor empty before processing.\n  - **Integer validation for commands**: Introduced assertions to validate that the arguments for commands such as `mark`, `unmark`, and `delete` are integers.\n  - **Non-empty task descriptions**: For commands like `todo` and `find`, ensured that the task description or search term is not empty.\n  - **Correct format for deadline and event commands**: Validated that the `deadline` command includes both the task and a valid `/by` date, and the `event` command contains both `/from` and `/to` times in the expected format.\n  - **Valid date-time parsing**: Added assertions to confirm that the date and time strings are valid and in the correct format before attempting to parse them.\n\nPurpose:\nThe assertions serve to document key assumptions in the code and provide early warnings if something goes wrong during runtime. This will make the application more reliable by detecting incorrect input formats or invalid data early in the execution process.\n\n---\n\nThis change improves the overall code safety and prevents potential bugs caused by invalid or malformed input.\n","tags":["A-Assertions"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":29,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"51b884c4929ac2264fd92b8645c655c628c3878c","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Improve Variable Naming in TaskList Class for Better Readability","messageBody":"This commit refactors the `TaskList` class by renaming several variables to improve clarity and code readability. The changes ensure that the names reflect their purpose more explicitly, making the code easier to understand without altering its functionality.\n\nKey Changes:\n- **Renamed `tasks` to `taskList`**: This makes it clear that the variable represents a collection of tasks.\n- **Renamed `index` to `taskIndex`**: Provides more specific context, indicating that the index refers to the position of a task within the list.\n- **Renamed `task` to `newTask`, `taskToMark`, `taskToUnmark`**: These new variable names clarify their specific role in the respective methods, making it obvious whether the task is being added, marked, or unmarked.\n\nPurpose:\nThe renaming of variables enhances code readability and maintainability without affecting the behavior of the `TaskList` class. These changes are purely cosmetic and ensure that the codebase is easier to follow and less error-prone for future modifications.\n\nNo changes were made to the public API or behavior of the class, so existing functionality remains intact.\n","tags":["A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":58,"deletions":32}}},{"hash":"0741dca408b1099b8707698c20f315686c5d6017","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add HelpCommand to Display Available Commands","messageBody":"This commit introduces a new `HelpCommand` to the Barry application. The `HelpCommand` provides users with a list of all available commands and their usage details.
