However, this directory is not automatically created if it does not already exist, leading to potential issues when trying to save tasks.\n\nTo address this, I\u0027ve added a createDataDirectory method that checks if the \"data\" directory exists and creates it if it doesn\u0027t. This change ensures that the application will always have a valid location to save tasks, preventing runtime errors related to missing directories.\n\nThis approach is chosen to improve the reliability of file operations, particularly in cases where the application is run in environments where the directory may not be present by default.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":7,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":23,"deletions":1}}},{"hash":"594b34004c65408cb88c2d64b24f2d5b92c600eb","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Save

and can be reloaded when the program restarts, providing a consistent user experience.\n\nLet\u0027s:\n* Implement a `saveTasks` method to write the task list to a file.\n* Ensure tasks are saved after marking as done or not done, adding new tasks, and deleting tasks.\n* Create a data directory if it doesn\u0027t exist to avoid file path issues.\n\nSaving tasks after each modification is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that users do not lose their progress.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":27,"deletions":6}}},{"hash":"d87feef0169972287b8550652745ca9d668d7a55","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add method to load tasks from file at startup","messageBody":"Tasks were not being persisted across sessions, leading to loss of data every time the program restarted.\n\nLoading tasks from a file ensures that users can continue from where they left off in the previous session, enhancing user experience and data consistency.\n\nLet\u0027s:\n* Implement a `loadTasks` method to read tasks from a file at startup.\n* Parse the saved task data, reconstruct task objects, and add them to the task list.\n* Handle different task types (Todo, Deadline, Event) during the load process, ensuring accurate restoration of task details.\n* Ensure that tasks marked as done are correctly restored with their completed status.\n\nThis change provides continuity for users by allowing them to resume their task management without losing progress.\n","tags":["Level-7"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":2,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":49,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"7a1021c94599400b56ae27682dd17bfd0ad2a139","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Implement
