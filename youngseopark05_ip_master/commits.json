It also allows\nusers to form an emotional attachment to the\nchatbot so they can enjoy spending time interacting\nwith it.\n\nLet\u0027s rename this chatbot \u0027HypeBot\u0027.\n\nRenaming this chatbot to reflect its desired personality\nof a cheerful, motivating companion sets users\u0027\nexpectations on how their interactions with the chatbot\nare going to

greeting and exit methods","messageBody":"There is only a greeting that is triggered in the\nmain() method.\n\nThe lack of an exit and the lack of separation\nbetween a greeting and an exit complicate the\nstart and end of the conversation between the\nuser and the bot.\n\nExtracting the greeting and exit behaviour\neach allows us to control the interface at the\nstart and end of the conversation between the\nuser and the bot.\n\nLet\u0027s make a greet() method that welcomes the\nuser and and exit() method that wishes them\ngoodbye.\n\nSeparating the greeting and exit message ensures\nthey

logo and greeting","messageBody":"Logo is multiple concatenated strings,\nwhile greeting does not directly prompt\nuser for a command.\n\nNot being able to visualise the logo\nas a single string block makes adjusting\nmistakes in ASCII art difficult, while\nnot directly prompting user for a command\ncould confuse user and prevent them\nfrom initiating interaction with HypeBot.\n\nLet\u0027s convert

support for echo","messageBody":"HypeBot has no support for accepting user\ninput or reacting to it.\n\nHypeBot needs to be able to accept user\ninput and have some kind of input handling\nso that when the user types in some form of\nexit command, HypeBot is able to act accordingly\nby calling the exit() method.\n\nLet\u0027s use a Scanner and a while loop that\nconstantly checks whether the exit\ncommand \u0027bye\u0027 in any form of\ncapitalisation to exit, otherwise\nrepeat the user\u0027s input allows us to\nachieve basic echo functionality.\n\nUsing a temporary boolean variable as\nthe condition for the input loop\nallows us to store the command entered,\nprocess it into lowercase so we don\u0027t\nhave to test for all combinations which\nthe command \u0027bye\u0027 can be entered.\n","tags":["Level-1"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":18,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"25e6f7d9743558e623335d099f99c44a8094f69d","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add
