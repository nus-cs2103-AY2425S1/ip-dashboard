This is inconvenient for users who need to maintain a persistent task list.\n\nThis commit adds functionality to automatically save the task list to a file (`./data/sammy.txt`) whenever it changes. It also loads the task list from the file when the chatbot starts. This ensures that tasks are preserved across sessions.\n\nLet\u0027s handle cases where the file or folder doesn\u0027t exist by creating them when necessary. File paths are specified in an OS-independent way to ensure cross-platform compatibility.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":202,"deletions":99}}}]},{"date":"2024-09-02","commitResults":[{"hash":"2ed1e9deb698c0013906463200c738f7dbb1c2ab","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level-8: Add support for parsing and storing dates and times","messageBody":"Teach the chatbot to understand and parse dates and times for tasks.\nStore deadlines as `LocalDateTime` in task objects and accept various\ndate formats such as `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` or `d/M/yyyy HHmm`.
