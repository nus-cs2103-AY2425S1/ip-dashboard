7: Save tasks to disk","messageBody":"Current situation: Tasks managed by the chatbot are not persisted between sessions, leading to a loss of data whenever the application is restarted.\n\nWhy it needs to change: Users need their task data to be saved and loaded automatically to ensure continuity and avoid manual re-entry of tasks each time the chatbot is used.\n\nWhat is being done about it: Implement automatic saving of the task list to the hard disk whenever any changes are made. Load the task data from the disk when the chatbot starts up.\n\nWhy it is done that way: Hard-coding the file path (./data/derek.txt) and saving the tasks in a simple text format ensures a straightforward and reliable method of persistence that aligns with the current project scope.\n\nAny other relevant info: The file format includes task type, completion status, task details, and any relevant timestamps. This format was chosen for its simplicity and ease of parsing.\n","tags":["Level-7"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":174,"deletions":14}}},{"hash":"b8648b7ad5b8547b2a1d262fa5d5ec47b3fbf429","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge Level 7 branch into master","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"585848917e1fcc0af0a255edbc1655ad4931aa20","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 8: Implement date and time handling for tasks","messageBody":"Current situation: The chatbot currently treats date and time inputs as plain strings without any understanding of their actual meaning or structure.\n\nWhy it needs to change: Users need the chatbot to recognize and manage deadlines and events with accurate date and time information, allowing for more meaningful task management and scheduling.\n\nWhat is being done about it: Implement the ability to parse and store dates and times as LocalDateTime objects in task-related classes. Accept input in formats like yyyy-MM-dd and output in a user-friendly format such as MMM dd yyyy hh:mm a. Additionally, add support for recognizing and formatting date and time inputs correctly when creating tasks.\n\nWhy it is done that way: Using LocalDateTime allows for robust and flexible handling of date and time data, ensuring tasks can be managed accurately. It also enables future extensions, such as filtering tasks by date or checking for upcoming deadlines.\n\nAny other relevant info: This change lays the groundwork for further enhancements, such as commands to filter or list tasks based on specific dates, improving the overall functionality and user experience of the chatbot.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":0,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":42,"deletions":24}}},{"hash":"4c5d8efc796f5784297f4c3a8ab5f18674d93e0f","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch-Level-8 into master","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-8"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]},{"date":"2024-08-30","commitResults":[{"hash":"f6af9b0c7487d77785623e6ca3c48ae004cccde4","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add more OOP","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":492,"deletions":418}}},{"hash":"3150c65745b89116226d1561a2e051cc20d2b32b","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Refactor Code to Extract Core Functionalities into Separate Classes","messageBody":"Current Situation:\nThe current code structure has multiple responsibilities handled within a single class, leading to a tightly coupled and less maintainable codebase. The code lacks clear separation of concerns, making it harder to understand, test, and extend.\n\nWhy It Needs to Change:\nThe lack of modularity increases the complexity of the code, making it difficult to manage and maintain. By having multiple responsibilities in one place, the code violates the Single Responsibility Principle, which can lead to more bugs and challenges in implementing future changes or enhancements.\n\nWhat Is Being Done About It:\nRefactor the code to extract out closely related functionalities into dedicated classes:\n- Ui: Handles all interactions with the user.\n- Storage: Manages the loading and saving of tasks from and to a file.\n- Parser: Interprets and processes user commands.\n- TaskList: Manages the task list, including operations to add or delete tasks.\n\nWhy It Is Done That Way:\nThis refactoring adheres to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), particularly the Single Responsibility Principle. By extracting specific responsibilities into their respective classes, the code becomes more modular, easier to understand, and more straightforward to test. This approach also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements and ensures that each class is focused on a single responsibility.\n","tags":["A-MoreOOP"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"2fa0ff670dbbce71a80f19a788287bb718f3d685","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Organize classes into suitable packages","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Packages"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":99,"deletions":9}}},{"hash":"ae535cf9e66592dc250bb8fcae387726ab5a5a87","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Add-gradle-support","messageBody":"","tags":["Add-gradle-support"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"795d35a66c87586720aa89ba61868ca329782ddf","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add J-Unit tests","messageBody":"","tags":["A-JUnit"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":106,"deletions":59}}},{"hash":"aee7ac0039b28756ae62c6e77b5a761626bc20f7","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add error checking for list size in commands","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Jar"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":3,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"cfd5d27f5238c2c8fde4cb698afdb6e2aa2629cd","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Java Doc Comments","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":373,"deletions":22}}},{"hash":"f5e30ceeb63372db2e8319fdb583e94be480b5a3","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Implement Coding Standard","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":45,"deletions":11}}},{"hash":"9eefa96b16da0380ddeb13f94c0ea68a3cce171c","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Level-9","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":70,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"cada9a116c007927a093b8b7416f9b40d223b4a2","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Resolve merge conflicts","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"1cdfa4aa008287b9f01501a4b8963ccf8d5a9c39","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Resolve merge conflicts","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-9","A-JavaDoc","A-Gradle","A-CodingStandard"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]},{"date":"2024-08-31","commitResults":[{"hash":"eaa408539a1a3633cd29fdda3d8438b4f8690da9","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add checkstyle","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Checkstyle"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":5,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":51,"deletions":54}}}]},{"date":"2024-09-06","commitResults":[{"hash":"287dd0d0b58e56b5cbd5e13c252bae2ab9e0f346","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add JavaFX functionality","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"fxml":{"insertions":67,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"9aea4134fcda271fd281755af060a2d81f4653c4","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add JavaFX functionality","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-10"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":16,"deletions":2},"fxml":{"insertions":1,"deletions":2},"java":{"insertions":305,"deletions":72}}},{"hash":"529e0e2228aa8afe891764d34bdfa5ccffc9483d","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Debug JavaFX GUI","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":121,"deletions":110}}}]},{"date":"2024-09-13","commitResults":[{"hash":"ad2e9ea2f9b9bc525caecc74c3f2758a61db8c23","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add A-Enums","messageBody":"","tags":["A-FullCommitMessage","A-Enums"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":268,"deletions":211}}},{"hash":"15d6975814c6acd87b20aa444ea22c2f40a0cde3","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Refactor codebase to follow SLAP and improve structure","messageBody":"The codebase contains several long and deeply nested methods, making the code difficult to read, maintain, and debug.\n\nThis needs to change to improve modularity, maintainability, and readability of the code.\n\nRefactor the affected methods by splitting them into smaller, focused methods.
