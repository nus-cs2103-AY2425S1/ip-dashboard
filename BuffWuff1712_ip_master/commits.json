Moved the command parsing logic from the `BingBongBot` class into a dedicated `Parser` class.\n  - This improves modularity and makes the command interpretation process more isolated and easier to maintain.\n\n- **Introduced Command Classes**:\n  - Created a set of `Command` classes (e.g., `AddCommand`, `ListCommand`, `MarkCommand`) to encapsulate different types of user commands.\n  - This follows the Command design pattern, promoting flexibility and making it easier to add or modify commands in the future without disrupting the botâ€™s core logic.\n\n- **Extracted TaskList Class**:\n  - Introduced a `TaskList` class to encapsulate the collection of tasks.\n  - This class manages tasks more effectively, providing a clear API for adding, removing, and retrieving tasks.\n  - By abstracting the task management into its own class, the bot\u0027s code becomes cleaner and easier to manage.\n\n- **Enhanced Readability and Maintainability**:\n  - The refactor breaks down the monolithic logic into smaller, well-defined classes, improving code readability and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.\n  - Each class now has a focused responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\n- **Improved Flexibility for Future Enhancements**:\n  - The new architecture supports easier extension of functionality, such as adding new commands or modifying task management, with minimal impact on the overall system.\n\nThis refactor represents a significant step towards a more scalable, flexible, and maintainable codebase, setting the stage for future development and enhancements.\n","tags":["A-MoreOOP"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]},{"date":"2024-08-24","commitResults":[{"hash":"a48a93d25f41f7593204bb0d4415c2968be69b7f","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Packages","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":1,"deletions":3},"java":{"insertions":130,"deletions":21},"bat":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},{"hash":"33a7723cbd4a575befbd4261d9aa8db2edad67ad","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-A-Packages\u0027 Organised the classes into suitable java packages for better management of java files","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Packages"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"6f5ce12a3c2795dd6c418a521206f92e30ff177b","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027add-gradle-support\u0027 Adding gradle support for Automation Testing","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Gradle"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"87ad7478026658c55c33ac5723686cbeb9105463","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add ParserTest and TodoTest JUnit test files","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":79,"deletions":14}}},{"hash":"1ce76a70a80da69f7f07750160a1f12c22ced367","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-A-JUnit\u0027 Added basic JUnit tests to test the functionality of Parser and Todo classes","messageBody":"","tags":["A-JUnit"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"eed104a07f4aed2f54235322a04362e395559259","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add main.jar file","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":3,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"bfb381e15989c17d0d410176d6fc58093e253fcb","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-A-Jar\u0027","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Jar"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"b73d2c3f67bcf1d0cfdcc47f27ecc65f1a120343","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add JavaDoc to core and task package files","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":363,"deletions":30}}},{"hash":"b5963ea6449d96ad5971c97434d739f48c88e90f","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Edit code to comply with Coding Standard","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":53,"deletions":39}}},{"hash":"2d47fc4341f88a43f3e56a80e709256a70ac68ea","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Find command using keyword","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":59,"deletions":3}}}]},{"date":"2024-08-25","commitResults":[{"hash":"c1d739ea7ab6984038bdf328bad97a4a4728d8f5","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-Level-9\u0027 Master branch is to be updated with the new Find feature","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-9"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"1069fa314c4fb8fed6d4fa9be267537f3e50e4c6","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-A-CodingStandard\u0027 Master branch now complies with coding standard after merge","messageBody":"","tags":["A-CodingStandard"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"84377b5c2f316802b4e896130a2b010bee3a79fe","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-A-JavaDoc\u0027","messageBody":"Fixed merge conflicts between master and branch-A-JavaDoc\n","tags":["A-JavaDoc"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}}]},{"date":"2024-08-31","commitResults":[{"hash":"f6ab24f84df22cc7482506af99874364b2533cbe","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Basic JavaFX GUI to BingBong app","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":15,"deletions":1},"txt":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"fxml":{"insertions":80,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":633,"deletions":179}}},{"hash":"137846eaf573173e420633c09a56ef093ed668a5","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-Level-10\u0027 Add a basic JavaFX GUI to the chatbot application","messageBody":"This merge integrates a JavaFX-based graphical user interface (GUI) into the chatbot, replacing the previous text-based interaction model.
